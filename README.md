Welcome to hideNsneak.
===============================
![Alt text](assets/logo.png "hideNsneak")
This application assists in managing attack infrastructure for penetration testers by providing an interface to rapidly deploy, manage, and take down various cloud services. These include VMs, domain fronting, Cobalt Strike servers, API gateways, and firewalls.

Overview
---------
hideNsneak provides a simple interface that allows penetration testers to build ephemeral infrastructure -- one that requires minimal overhead. 
hideNsneak can: 

* *`deploy`, `destroy`, and `list`*
	1. Cloud instances via EC2, Google Cloud, Digital Ocean, Azure, and Alibaba Cloud
	2. API Gateway (AWS)
	3. Domain fronts via CloudFront and Azure Cloudfront

* *Proxy into said infrastructure*
* *Send and receive files*
* *Port scanning via NMAP*
* *Remote installations of Burp Collab, Cobalt Strike, Socat, LetsEncrypt, GoPhish, and SQLMAP*


Running locally
---------------
*A few disclosures for V 1.0:*
* At this time, all hosts are assumed `Ubuntu 16.04 Linux`. In the future, we're hoping to add on a docker container to decrease initial setup time
* The only cloud providers currently setup are AWS and Digital Ocean
* *You need to make sure that go is installed.* Instructions can be found [here](https://golang.org/dl/)

1. Create a new AWS S3 bucket in `us-east-1`
	- Ensure this is not public as it will hold your terraform state
2. `go get github.com/rmikehodges/hideNsneak`
3. `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/rmikehodges/hideNsneak`
4. `./setup.sh`
5. `cp config/example-config.json config/config.json` 
	- fill in the values
	- aws_access_id, aws_secret_key, aws_bucket_name are required at minimum
6. now you can use the program by running `./hidensneak [command]`

Commands
---------
* `hidensneak help` --> run this anytime to get available commands

For all commands, you can run `--help` after any of them to get guidance on what flags to use.


Organization
------------
* `_terraform` --> terraform modules 
* `_ansible` --> ansible roles and playbooks 
* `_assets` --> random assets for the beauty of this project
* `_cmd` --> frontend interface package 
* `_deployer` --> backend commands and structs
* `main.go` --> where the magic happens 


Contributions
-------------
We would love to have you contribute to hideNsneak. Feel free to pull the repo and start contributing, we will review pull requests as we receive them. If you feel like some things need improvement or some features need adding, feel free to open up an issue and hopefully -- someone will pick it up. 

Miscellaneous
-------------
A default security group `hideNsneak` is made in all AWS regions that is full-open. All instances are configured with `iptables` to *only allow port 22/tcp* upon provisioning. 

If your program starts throwing terraform errors indicating a resource is not found, then you may need to remove the problematic terraform resources. You can do this by running the following:

`cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/rmikehodges/hideNsneak/terraform`

`terraform state rm <name of problem resource>`

This resource will need to be cleaned up manually if it still exists.
